Small collection of 010 templates for some of the file formats used in Dirge Of Cerberus.

* Download [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor)

* Open the file with the right extension, then "**Template -> Open Template**". Finally, "**Template -> Run Template**"

* In the template section with the different variables that just appeared, right click and enable "**Show local variables**". This step only has to be done once.

For more information about the different fields, refer to the [Dirge wiki](https://github.com/DoC-Research/Documentation/wiki).
